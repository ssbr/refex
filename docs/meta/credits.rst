Refex is just some 20% project, so it's been incredibly gratifying to have
people's support and contribution. Thank you!

Due to copyright assignment and squashed export commits, not all of the
contributors are represented in the change history or copyright notice. Refex
owes a huge debt of gratitude to *all* its contributors:

* Chris Rebert (`@cvrebert <https://github.com/cvrebert>`_)
* Devin Jeanpierre (`@ssbr <https://github.com/ssbr>`_)
* Gregory P. Smith (`@gpshead <https://github.com/gpshead>`_)
* Joshua Morton (`@joshuamorton <https://github.com/joshuamorton>`_)
* Matthew Suozzo
* Nathan Marrow
* Nick Smith (`@soupytwist <https://github.com/soupytwist>`_)
* Richard Levasseur (`@rickeylev <https://github.com/rickeylev>`_)

Refex would also not be possible without the amazing
`asttokens <https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens>`_ library, and of course
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ itself.
